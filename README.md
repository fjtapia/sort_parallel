[sort::parallel] (https://github.com/fjtapia/sort_parallel) 
=============================================================

*    In this **parallel library**, you can find stable and not stable sort algorithms, in a **single thread and parallel version**, 
     with similar performance than the provided by other libraries as TBB, Cilk, OpenMP or IPP.   
    
*    The intention is to create algorithms **only with the utilities provided by C++11**, without any other library. 
     Any C++11 compliant compiler can compile and run these algorithms.
      
*    These algorithms are **generic** and can sort any kind of object using a comparison object, in contrast with the 
     **hybrid radix** algorithms, such as spreadsort, which require indexing functors to sort objects other than integers, strings and float values in a single 
     thread version, but with a speed greater than the generic comparison-based sort algorithms.
     
*    The algorithms are **exception safe**, meaning that the exceptions generated by the algorithms guarantee the integrity 
     of the objects being sorted, but not their relative order. 
     If the exception is generated inside the objects (in the move or in the copy constructor..) the results can be unpredictable.

Benchmarks
--------------	

The speed of the algorithm over a machine depend, mainly of the algorithm, but also of the processor (speed, number of HW threads), memory and cache memory.

In the folder benchmarks, you have an easy and fast benchmark, for to check the speed of the algorithms on your computer.

There are versions for several compilers. In the folder you can find a README.txt with instructions about how to run the benchmarks.

The compilation need about 2 mins and the running about 5 mins, depending of your computer.

  * *GCC* :GCC compiler over a Linux x64
  * *CLANG* : CLANG compiler over a Linux x64
  * *VC++* : Visual C++ over a Windows

This library had been created for to be integrated in the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) Library, inside 
the [boost::sort library] (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/sort), with the spreadsort algorithms designed and implemented by Steven Ross. 	
It is pending of the final approval, due this, can suffer some changes until the final version and definitive approval in the Boost Library.

Installation
--------------
* This library is include only.	
* Don't need to link with any static or dynamic library.	 
* Don't have any dependence of any other Boost or external libraries.	 
* For to use, only need a to include the files of the boost/sort/parallel folder, any more.	
* This library had been compiled successfully with the next compilers : GCC 4.7, GCC 4.8, GCC 4.9 , CLANG 3.6, Visual C++ 2013 Update 4, Visual C++ 2015
